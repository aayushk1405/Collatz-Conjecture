# Collatz-Conjecture
Hello there!
My Name is Aayush, and I have a great interest for the subject of mathematics and enjoy learning and exploring new and cool stuff in Math.

One of the interesting things I came across was the Collatz Conjecture, and approached the topic entirely on my own without referring to any books or articles, just naively selecting random numbers and doing brute-force iterations. I got so involved in it that I decided to write my own article on this topic.

This small repository contains **My take on the Collatz Conjecture**, an extremely interesting conjecture which hasnt been solved till date.

Here I have mentioned a couple of observations which I made about the pattern this conjecture follows, which might seem a bit obvious but still I wanted to share as to how did I reach these conclusions.

If you're reading this,I encourage you to read it more from an enthusiast's point of view rather than that of an expert or a Mathematician and Im sure you will find it interesting and relatable :))
